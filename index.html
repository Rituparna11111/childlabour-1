      <h3>Stop Child labour and save the children</h3>
        <img src="images\pic8.jpeg" alt="image" height="200" width="300">
      <p class="mid">No child should be working. All children have the right to a good education, the right to play and the right to enjoy their childhood. Child labour means that poverty continues to exist. Eradicating child labour means development and better opportunities for everyone.Child labour can result in extreme bodily and mental harm, and even death. It can lead to slavery and sexual or economic exploitation. And in nearly every case, it cuts children off from schooling and health care, restricting their fundamental rights and threatening their futures</p>

        <h2>Some of the root causes of child labour</h2>
        <div class="causes">
          <h3>Poverty</h3>
          <img class="cause-1"src="images\pic5.jpg" alt="cause-1" height="225">
          <p>Poverty is certainly the greatest single force driving children into the workplace.When families cannot afford to meet their basic needs like food,water,education or health care,they have no choice but to send their children to work to supplement the household income. Poverty is considered as one of the most important causes of child labour as it is linked to other driving factors including: low literarcy and numeracy rates, lack of decent work opportunities, natural disasters and climate change, conflicts and mass displacement. Poverty and child labour form a vicious cycle, without tackling one, we cannot eradicate the other.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="causes">
          <h3>Poor access to decent work</h3>
          <img class="cause-2" src="images\pic6.jpg" alt="cause-2" height="210">
          <p>Children who were involved in child labour often lack the basic educational grounding which would enable them to acquire skills and to improve their prospects for a decent adult working life.If young people cannot access work which is safe, with social protection, fair pay, equality for men and women and which provides a space for workers to express their opinions, they often have no choice but to do work which is hazardous. When children above the minimum working age are doing hazardous work, this is also considered child labour.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="causes">
          <h3>Limited understanding of child labour</h3>
          <img class="cause-3"  src="images\pic7.jpg" alt="cause-3">
          <p>The view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. When families do not understand the dangers of child labour, and how these impact on the health, safety, well-being and future of their child, they are more likely to send their children to work. Some cultural beliefs and social norms can also be drivers of child labour.</p>

     <h3>Affect of the child labour</h3>
     <img src="images\pic8.jpg" alt="image" height="200" width="300">
     <p class="affect">Child labor was found to be associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including but not limited to poor growth, malnutrition, higher incidence of infectious and system-specific diseases, behavioral and emotional disorders, and decreased coping efficacy.</p>
     <p class="affect">General injuries like cuts, burns, lacerations, fractures and dizziness are very common. Sexual abuse, STDs, HIV/AIDS, drugs, alcoholism, sexual exploitation of girls, rape, prostitution are also the consequences of child labour. They also face physical neglect in food, clothing, shelter and medical treatment.</p>
     <div class="affect-on-env">
       <h3>Child labour affect the environment</h3>
       <img class="affect-env"src="images\pic9.jpg" alt="image">
       <p class="effect-env">Worldwide, more than 150 million children work to support their families. Child labour is a direct consequence of poverty, but the fact that it is closely linked to environmental degradation is a new facet of this problem.</p>
     </div>
     <h2>Law against child labour</h2>
     <img src="images\pic10.jpg" alt="image" height="200" width="250">
     <p class="law" >Article 24 of the Indian constitution clearly states that, "No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or employed in any hazardous employment." The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986 designates a child as a person who has not completed their 14th year of age. It aims to regulate the hours and the working conditions of child workers and to prohibit child workers from being employed in hazardous industries.</p>
